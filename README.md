# OBS Volume Animations
## Description
This is a python plugin for OBS, that lets you hide/show 2 scene items based on the volume of your microphone input.
The plugin uses your system input, not the OBS one.
Currently it only works on Linux as the audio source defaults to pipewire.
## Usage
1. In OBS go to Tools â†’ Scripts
2. Click the plus button and select this script
3. Configure the plugin
