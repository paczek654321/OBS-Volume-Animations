# OBS Volume Animations
## Description
This is a python plugin for OBS, that lets you hide/show 2 scene items based on the volume of your microphone input.
The plugin uses your system input, not the OBS one.
In order for this plugin to work on Windows you have to change the adio device, one that seems to work is: "Microsoft Sound mapping - Input"
## Usage
1. In OBS go to Tools â†’ Scripts
2. Click the plus button and select this script
3. Configure the plugin
